# Progress: VibeCodingChecklist.com

## Current Status

*   **Overall:** Project Scaffolding phase. Initial Next.js project created and restructured for Vercel deployment. Memory Bank updated. Awaiting detailed content definitions from user-provided prompt module outputs.
*   **Date:** March 28, 2025

## What Works

*   The `memory-bank` directory structure is created and populated with initial documentation.
*   `.clinerules` file exists and is being followed.
*   Initial review of all memory bank files completed.
*   Project focus clarified: Educational hub for vibe coding.
*   Next.js project files moved from `vibecodingchecklist-site/` to the root directory.
*   Empty `vibecodingchecklist-site/` directory removed.
*   Changes committed and pushed to GitHub.
*   `activeContext.md` updated to reflect current status and next steps.
*   Replaced `src/app/page.tsx` and `src/app/layout.tsx` with minimal working versions to troubleshoot root route 404.
*   Corrected `next.config.ts` by removing unnecessary `experimental.appDir` setting.
*   Resolved persistent Tailwind v4 build errors ("unknown utility class: text-neutral-*") through configuration adjustments (`tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`), dependency reinstallation (`@tailwindcss/typography`, `autoprefixer`), and cache clearing.
*   Fixed TypeScript syntax error in `src/app/rss/route.ts`.
*   Applied initial dark mode theme styling and typography improvements to layout, homepage, and guide layout components.

## What's Left to Build / Next Steps

*   **Receive Prompt Module Outputs:** Await user to provide outputs for the 7 defined modules (Mission, Personas, Content Architecture, Formats, AI Enhancements, UI Blocks, Schema).
*   **Verify Vercel Deployment:** Commit changes, push, and redeploy on Vercel to confirm the root route (`/`) is now working (resolves 404).
*   **(If successful) Restore Original Homepage:** Revert `src/app/page.tsx` and `src/app/layout.tsx` to their previous state (or integrate dynamic content as planned).
*   **Production Polish:** Address SEO, Open Graph, `.env` configuration.
*   **Implement UI Blocks:** Based on Module 6 output.
*   **Implement Content Structure:** Based on Module 3 output.
*   **Implement Article Formats:** Based on Module 4 output.
*   **Integrate AI Features:** Based on Module 5 output.
*   **Implement SEO:** Based on Module 7 output.
*   **Populate Initial Content:** Based on module outputs and further user input.

## Known Issues / Blockers

*   **Root Route 404:** Previously resolved.
*   **Dependency:** Further content/feature implementation is blocked pending receipt of the 7 prompt module outputs from the user.
*   **Refine Dark Theme:** Continue applying and refining the dark mode theme across all components and content based on Notion/Medium inspiration.
*   **Anchor Link Styling:** Revisit `.anchor-link` styling in `globals.css` if the current fallback colors are not ideal (the `@apply` rules caused build issues previously).
